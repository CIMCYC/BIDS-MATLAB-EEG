# CONVERT BIDS FROM EEGLAB TO FIELDTRIP
 
This script simply changes the extension of the file (usually .set) obtained after exporting data to BIDS using EEGLAB (bids_export_eeglab.m) in order to be able to preprocess with fieldtrip (files are obtained in .mat format).

The presented file is generic for any experiment, so it should be adapted according to the needs of your experiment.
This is indicated where it appears ('replace with your own').

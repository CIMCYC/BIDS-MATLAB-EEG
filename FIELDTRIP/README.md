## SCRIPT TO CONVERT EEG RAW DATA TO BIDS FORMAT USING A MATLAB TOOLBOX BIDS VIA FIELDTRIP (BIDS_convert.m)

This script is used to export eeg data from different extensions to BIDS format. (https://bids.neuroimaging.io/).

The presented file is generic for any experiment, so it should be adapted according to the needs of your experiment.
This is indicated where it would be necessary.

The data will be output with the extension .vhdr (compatible with Fieltrip).

If you need to add more variables to BIDS files, you can find more information at http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org.
